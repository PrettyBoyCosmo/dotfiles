## Installation

Install via Cinnamon's Themes module in Cinnamon settings or download from [Cinnamon Spices](https://cinnamon-spices.linuxmint.com/themes) and unzip into your `~/.themes` directory.

Select the theme as your Desktop, Controls and Window Borders in the Cinnamon Themes module.

To allow the GTK2, GTK3 and Metacity1 themes to apply to GUI apps running as root run this command in your terminal after installation to create a symlink to the theme in the local system theme directory.

`sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/themes; sudo ln -s ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto /usr/local/share/themes/`

## Compatibility

This theme is compatible with Cinnamon versions `3.2.x`, `3.4.x`, `3.6.x`, `3.8.x`, `4.0.x`, `4.2.x`, `4.4.x`, `4.6.x`, `4.8.x`, `5.0.x` & `5.2.x`

The GTK3 themes require GTK `3.18.x` or `3.20.x`+

## Cinnamon Theme Font-Size

For Cinnamon version 4.6.x and later the Cinnamon theme's font characteristics van be set via changing the default font in Font Selection settings module available from the menu.

For users of older Cinnamon versions the theme includes an interactive bash script that allows end users to adjust the base font-size in the Cinnamon theme. This can be useful for users running Cinnamon on relatively high resolution displays with relatively small screen dimensions where the hard-coded theme default font-sizes are too small.

To access the tool open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T) and use the following command to make the script executable and launch it. 

`chmod +x ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/adapta_fontsize.sh && ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/adapta_fontsize.sh`

If you are not happy with the end result simply run `~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/adapta_fontsize.sh` again to chose another option including the default

## Cinnamon Stock Menu applet in Cinnamon 4.4.x and older

The app description area at the bottom of the stock cinnamon menu applet may not expand appropriately to fit the content in Cinnamon 4.4.x and older when text scaling factor is set > 1. 

The theme includes an interactive bash script that allows end users toggle an adjustment of the cinnamon.css to mitigate this behaviour.

To access the tool open a terminal window (Ctrl-Alt-T) and use the following command to make the script executable and launch it. 

`chmod +x ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/adapta_toggle_menufix.sh && ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/adapta_toggle_menufix.sh`

If you are not happy with the end result simply run `~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/adapta_toggle_menufix.sh` again to revert.

## Firefox fix

If you have problems seeing text on input fields in Firefox with any particular theme this problem can be solved by adding a `~/.mozilla/firefox/********.default/user.js` file to your Firefox default profile including the line `user_pref("widget.content.gtk-theme-override", "Adwaita");` and restarting Firefox.

This forces Firefox to use the GTK default Adwaita theme for rendering all website content.

The theme includes a helper script that creates the file with this content in the correct location. To access the tool open a terminal window and use the following command to make the script executable and launch it.

`chmod +x ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/firefox_fix.sh && ~/.themes/Adapta-Nokto/scripts/firefox_fix.sh`
